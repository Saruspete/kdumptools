# Why bash ?
Shell is the most low-level language for sysadmins.
And bash because it's the default shell for most Linux distributions

Perl ? I love it, but most people don't
Awk ? Even fewer people know how to use it

Other script langage ? We're doing sysadmin here. Not a website


# What tools are required
bash, getopt, grep, id, uname, 

I didn't used awk cause on some ultra-light systems, it's not installed
